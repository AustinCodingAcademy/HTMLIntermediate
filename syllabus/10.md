# The Document Object Model

When you access a web page in the browser, a web server sends a string representing the document and the browser parses the string and renders the output to a screen.

The browser maintains this output as a series of nested nodes that can be updated in real time.

## Document structure

It is often helpful to imagine a web document as a set of boxes or containers. Take for example the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Austin Coding Academy</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>HTML Intermediate</h1>
        <p>I am Rob, you guys rock!</p>
        <p>Thanks for participating in this class. Do you know about <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>?</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The way a web browser represents a document is very similar to this. Each box is an object that has a tag, possibly some text, and other boxes. This is the (*Document Object Model* or the *DOM*.

There is a global property in `document` that gives us access to the `<html>` tag, the root of the html document is `documentElement`. Additionally, there are `head` and `body` properties that access those elements.

## Trees

The DOM is a tree. This means that the whole of the data structure has a root. Here its `document.documentElement`. Each node or branch of the tree may contain anything, except itself. Contents of those nodes most commonly are other nodes, text, or comments.

Each DOM node object has a `nodeType` property which contains a numeric code that identifies what type of node it is. Regular elements have the value 1, which is also defined as the constant property `document.ELEMENT_NODE`. Text nodes, representing a section of text in the document, have the value 3 (`document.TEXT_NODE`). Comments have the value 8 (`document.COMMENT_NODE`).

Another way to visualize a document is:

```
html--->head--->title->"Austin Coding Academy"
     +->body--->h1---->"HTML Intermediate"
             +->p----->"I am Rob, you guys rock!"
             +->p----->"Thanks for participating..."
                   +-->a--->"Reddit"
                   +-->"?"
```

## The standard

The reason the `nodeType`s are silly almost useless numbers is because the DOM wasn't written for Javascript. Other parts of the DOM are equally opaque. The DOM was devised as a language agnostic standard.

That the DOM wasn't written for Javascript becomes painfully clear when you try to do things with it. Take for example the `childNodes` property. This property looks like an array, but it doesn't have useful array methods like `slice` and `forEach`.

Additionally, there is no quick way to do something like creating a node and adding children or attributes all in one step.

## Moving through the tree

There are a bunch of useful properties for traversing a DOM structure. These include `childNodes`, `firstChild`, `lastChild`, `parentNode`, `previousSibling`, and `nextSibling`

## Finding elements

We can use traversing properties to get to just about anything in the DOM, but using only traversing is a less than optimal way. What if there was a way to get directly to an element and see its properties?

```javascript
var link = document.body.getElementsByTagName("a")[0];
console.log(link.href);
// http://reddit.com/
```

Every element nodes have the `getElementsByTagName` method which you can use to get specific child nodes in an array-like collection. If you know exactly what element you want, you can use `document.getElementById` instead.

```html
<p>My favorite robot</p>
<p><img id="bender" src="bender.jpg"></p>

<script>
    var robot = document.getElementById("bender");
    console.log(robot.src);
    // bender.jpg
</script>
```

Along the same vein as `getElementsByTagName` and `getElementById`, we have `getElementsByClassName`. This method searches the DOM for all the element nodes that have a specific class and returns something like an array with all those elements.

## Changing the document

We can change just about everything in the DOM and we have some methods that make that possible. The method `removeChild` removes a given node from the DOM. To add a node at the end of a node's list of children, we can use `appendChild`. Finally, we can use `insertBefore` to add a node given as the first argument before another node given as the second argument.

```html
<p>One</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Three</p>

<script>
    var paragraphs = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");
    document.body.insertBefore(paragraphs[2], paragraphs[0]);
</script>
```

Any given node may only exist in one place, so when we grab the third paragraph above and insert it before the first, paragraph three *moves* to the spot before paragraph one.

The `replaceChild` metho can be used to replace one node with another. It accepts two arguments, the first is the new node and the second is the node to be replaced. Remember, `replaceChild` and `insertBefore` both expect the new node to be their first argument.

## Creating nodes

Let's imagine we want to take all the images in a document and replace them with their `alt` text. We have to remove all the images and create a new node with their text. We can use the `document.createTextNode` method to do this.

```html
<p>David Bowie is: <img src="ziggy_stardust.jpg" alt="Ziggy Stardust"> and the <img src="martian_spiders.jpg" alt="Spiders from Mars">.
</p>

<p><button onclick="replaceImages()">Replace!</button></p>

<script>
function replaceImages() {
    var images = document.body.getElementsByTagName("img");
    for (var i = images.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        var image = images[i];
        if (image.alt) {
            var text document.createTextNode(image.alt);
            image.parentNode.replaceChild(text, image);
        }
    }
}
</script>
```

When we create a text node, we can just drop that in wherever and it'll render immediately.

The loop that goes through all the images does so backwards. This is because the DOM is a live representation of the web page, if we remove an element at the beginning, the remaining nodes immediately get renumbered, which will cause some unexpected and unwanted side-effects.

We can create regular element nodes by calling the `document.createElement` method. It accepts a string naming the tag we want to create and it creates an empty copy of that HTML tag.

## Attributes

Many tag attributes, such as `href` and `src`, can be accessed through a property with the same name.

HTML also allows us to get and set arbitrary attributes to any element node with one of several methods. 

First, `setAttribute` accepts two arguments, the first is the attribute to set and the second is the value of that attribute. `getAttribute` retrieves the value of a named attribute. 

There is `dataset`. `dataset` refers to any 'data-attribute' assigned to a node element. `dataset` is an object, so we can access its values by calling them without the 'data-' portion of their name. They can be set just like object properties are set and the 'data-' part of their name is automatically added.

```html
<ul>
    <li class="first"><a href="#ch1">List Item 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#ch2">List Item 2</a></li>
    <li data-action="remove"><a href="#ch3">List Item 3</a></li>
    <li><a href="#ch4">List Item 4</a></li>
    <li class="last"><a href="#ch5">List Item 5</a></li>
</ul>

<script>
    var lis = document.body.getElementsByTagName("li");
    Array.prototype.forEach.call(lis, function(li) {
        li.childNodes[0].setAttribute("target", "_blank");
        if (li.className === "first") {
            var strong = document.createElement("strong");
            strong.textContent = li.textContent;
            li.textContent = "";
            li.appendChild(strong);
        }
        if (li.dataset.action === 'remove') {
            li.parentNode.removeChild(li);
        }
        li.title = li.textContent;
    });
</script>
```

Lastly, when we want to get an element node's class, we access it via the `className` property because `class` is a Javascript reserved word.

## Layout

Most HTML elements are rendered with *block* styling. This includes `<li>`, `<p>`, `<div>` and more. Other elements are rendered with *inline* styling, such as `<span>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>`. Some elements render in other ways, but that's a different story.

We can access the height and width of elements in Javascript using various properties. `offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight` measure the amount of space an element takes up. `clientWidth` and `clientHeight` measures the inside size of an element, ignoring its border size.

```html
<p style="border: 10px solid red">Whip it good!</p>

<script>
    var para = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p")[0];
    console.log("clientHeight:", para.clientHeight);
    console.log("offsetHeight:", para.offsetHeight);
</script>
```

We can get the position of an element on a page using the `getBoundingClientRect` method. It returns an object that describes the top, right, bottom, and left relative to the upper left of the screen. We can calculate their position relative to the document by adding `pageXOffset` and `pageYOffset` values.

## Styling

We can access and set all the styles of an element node via its `style` property, which contains an object with all the possible style declarations that can be assigned to the node. Javascript style declarations follow the PascalCase pattern whereas CSS style declarations are hyphenated. In CSS, we would use `font-family` and the Javascript equivalent is `fontFamily`.

Styles added via Javascript are added inline. Inline styles are the most specific way to apply styles. More specific styles take precedence over less specific. Keep that in mind when using Javascript styles.

## Query selectors

Earlier we talked about `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, and `getElementsByTagName`, but there are better methods. `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` return a node object or an array of node objects. Both methods accept an CSS query to determine what elements to find and capture.

## Positioning and animating

We can use positioning along with Javascript to create animations. The following animates a picture of a cat in an elliptical motion.

```html
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://placekitten.com/g/300/300" style="position: relative"></p>

<script>
var cat = document.querySelector("img");
var angle = 0, lastTime = null;
function animate(time) {
    if (lastTime != null) {
        angle += (time - lastTime) * 0.001;
    }
    lastTime = time;
    cat.style.top = (Math.sin(angle) * 20) + "px";
    cat.style.left = (Math.cos(angle) * 200) + "px";
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}
requestAnimationFrame(animate);
</script>
```

We start with a centered and relatively positioned image of a kitten and we will repeatedly update its `top` and `left` styles to move it around.

We use `requestAnimationFrame` to schedule the `animate` function to run as soon as the browser is ready to render the screen. The `animate` function also calls `requestAnimationFrame` to schedule another update. `requestAnimationFrame` updates happen are roughly 60 frames per second.

When Javascript runs, the browser won't update. As we've talked about, Javascript is a blocking process, it prevents browser rendering. `requestAnimationFrame` pauses the Javascript process until the browser is ready to render.

## Summary

Javascript provides ways to traverse, search, and modify the DOM.

The DOM can be visualized as a tree with branches that represent nodes and leaves that represent text and comments.

We can modify the styles and read and write attributes of elements.

## Exercises

### Build a table

A few weeks ago, we built a table using plain text. HTML tables are way better and they look something like this:

```html
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Planet</th>
        <th>Earth masses</th>
        <th>Composition</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mercury</td>
        <td>0.055</td>
        <td>Rock</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

Using the planetary data we used before, write a function called `buildTable` that accepts that object and constructs a table in HTML and prints it to the document.

The `Object.keys` function, which returns an array containing the property names that an object has, will probably be useful.

Once you have the basics working, right-align cells containing numbers by setting their style.textAlign property to "right".
