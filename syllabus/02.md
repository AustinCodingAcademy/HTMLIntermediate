# Program Structure

## Expressions and statements

An *expression* is a bit of code that resolves to a value.  For example, `x = 10` is an expression. Another example is `5 + 6`.

A *statement* is a bit of code that ends in a semicolon. A statement also contains one or more expressions.

A *program* is composed of several statements.

## Variables

Variables are the most fundamental part of most programming languages. They are used to store and retrieve values, objects, and even functions.

```javascript
var a_number = 1999;
var a_string = "This is a string";
var a_boolean = false;
var a_null = null;
var im_undefined;

var a_function = function( value ) {
    return value;
}
var an_array = ["nfl", "nba", "mlb", "mlg"];
var an_object = {
    football: "goal",
    baseball: "run",
    number: 9001,
    method: function() {
        return this.number;
    }
}
```

## Keywords and Reserved Words

Some words in Javascript have special meanings, such as the `var` keyword above. *Keywords* cannot be used for variable names. The full list of reserved words includes:

> abstract await boolean break byte case catch char class const continue debugger default delete do double else enum export extends final finally float for function goto if implements import in instanceof int interface let long native new package private protected public return short static super switch synchronized this throw transient try typeof var void volatile while with yield

## The Environment

Even before a Javascript program runs, there is an environment that contains many built-in variables. For example, there are variables to read and control data in the URL bar and another variable that reads and writes to the browser history.

## Functions

Many of the variables built-in to the Javascript environment are *function*s. A function is a piece of program assigned to a value. In a browser, the variable `alert` contains a function that opens a dialog box and displays a message. Running a function is called *invoking*, *calling*, or *applying* it. Functions accept some number of *arguments* which you pass. The `alert` function only needs on, some others don't need any, and yet others can take many.

## console.log

You *can* use `alert`, but you'll quickly get tired of frequently closing pop ups. Modern browsers and Node.js all support the `console.log` function. `console.log` outputs whatever you pass to it in the browser's Javascript console. This part of the browser interface is hidden by default, but most browsers open it when you press F12 or, on Mac, when you press Command-Option-I. If that does not work, search through the menus for an item named “web console” or “developer tools”.

## document.write & document.writeln

We can also print output directly to the document. `document.write` does just this.

```javascript
var dadJoke = 'Vampire walks into a bar and says, "I\'ll have a blood lite".';
document.write(dadJoke);
```

`document.writeln` works the same way, except it also adds a newline (`\n`) character at the end.

## Return Values

When a Javscript function creates an alert or changes something in the window, you are producing a *side-effect*. Other functions, such as `String.toUpperCase` which takes a string and makes it all uppercase, *return* a value.

## Prompt and Confirm

Browser environments have other functions in addition to `alert` for popping up windows. You can request an "OK/Cancel" question by using `confirm`. This returns "true" when they click "OK" and "false" when they click "Cancel".

```javascript
confirm("Yo dawg, are you sure about that?");
```

The `prompt` function allows you to ask an open question. The user can enter any data. The entered data will be returned as a string.

```javascript
prompt("Who do you think you are?", "");
```

Modern coding practices typically eschew using `confirm` and `prompt`, but they can still be useful for testing and development.

## Control Flow

When you run a Javascript program, it executes from top to bottom. The following basic example requests a user enters a number, then alerts the user what that number is a square-root of.

```javascript
var the_number = Number(prompt("Pick a number", ""));
alert("Your number is the square root of "the_number * the_number);
```

The user is presented a prompt, where they input a number. Remember, `prompt` returns a string, so we call that within the `Number` function to convert it to a number. Next, the user is given an alert that tells them the square of that number.

## Conditional Statements

We don't always have to execute statements from top-to-bottom. Sometimes we want to execute code if, and only if some conditions are met. For example, what if we only want to run the statements above if the value is a number?

```javascript
var the_number = Number(prompt("Pick a number", ""));
if (!isNaN(the_number)) {
    alert("Your number is the square root of "the_number * the_number);
}
```

Now, if you enter "Scooby-Doo", the alert won't fire.

An if statement will only execute if the expression passed to it is true.

```javascript
if (true) {
    // perform some javascript statements...
};
```

Maybe you want to run some code if an expression is true and a different one if its false. In that case, you would use an if-else statement.

```javascript
if (true) {
    // perform some javascript statements...
} else {
    // perform some javascript statements...
};
```

What if you want to check for more than one possible true condition and fall back on a default.

```javascript
if (true) {
    // perform some javascript statements...
} else if (true) {
    // perform some javascript statements...
} else {
    // perform some javascript statements...
};
```

## While and Do While

A while loop will perform one or more statements for as long as some condition remains true.

```javascript
var number = 0;
while (number < 10) {
    // perform some javascript statements...
    num++;
}
```

Depending on what conditions you are testing for, the above block may not run at all. You may, in fact, want the code to run at least once before evaluating for truthiness. To do that, we use a do-while loop. A do-while loop will run form top-to-bottom, and then evaluate a condition and continue to run as long as that condition is true.

```javascript
var number = 0;
do {
    // perform some javascript statements...
    num++;
} while (number < 10);
```

## For Loops

While loops can run forever, or at least until some conditions are proven to be false. If you want to perform a block of code a specific number of times, you can use a for loop. For loops require 3 arguments. The first is a definition of a new variable which will be used as a counter. Next, you define an expression that tracks the truthfulness of that counter. Finally, you update the counter.

```javascript
for (var number = 0; number < 10; number ++) {
    console.log(number);
}
```

## Breaking Out of a Loop

Having a loop statement return `false` isn't the only way to get out of a loop. Sometimes you want to check for a special condition and break out early.

```
for (var current = 8; ; current++) {
  if (current % 7 == 0)
    break;
}
console.log(current); // 14
```

## Switch Statements

```javascript
switch (val) {
    case "string":
        // perform some javascript statements...
        break;
    case true:
    case false:
        // perform some javascript statements...
        break;
    case 0:
        // perform some javascript statements...
        break;
    default:
        // perform some javascript statements...
}
```

# Homework

## Triangle Loop

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

Tip: You can find out how many characters are in a string by checking its `.length`.

```javascript
var str = "hello";
console.log(str.length); // 5
```

## FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, for numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

##  Checkerboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chess board.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

```
"
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
"
```

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
