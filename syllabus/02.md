# Primitives

There are six primitive data types:

* Boolean
* Null
* Number
* String
* Symbol
* Undefined

## Boolean

Booleans represent 'on' and 'off', or 'yes' and 'no'. Booleans come in two flavors, `true` and `false`.

## Null

`null` means that the variable has no value. More specifically `null` means that a varaible has been given a value of 'no value'. `null` is usually interchangeable with `undefined`, however there are some caveats. We'll cover that when we talk about equality.

## Number

Numbers are numbers, but only when they aren't strings.

```
typeof 55; // number
typeof "55"; // string
```

You can convert a string to a number using the global `parseInt()` and  `parseFloat()` methods.

```
var num = "10";
var flt = "55.55";

parseInt(num); // 10
parseFloat(flt); // 55.55
```

## String

A string is zero or more characters enclosed in single (') or double (") quotation marks.

* 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.'
* "The quick brown fox"
* '8675309'
* "What 'cha talkin' bout, willis?"

You can concatenate strings.

```
var str1 = "The rain in Spain ";
var str2 = "falls mainly on the plains";

var str3 = str1 + str2;
console.log(str3); // "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plains"
```

Some useful string methods include:

```
var sample = "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plains";

sample.split(" "); // ["The", "rain", "in", "Spain", "falls", "mainly", "on", "the", "plains"]

sample.toUpperCase(); // "THE RAIN IN SPAIN FALLS MAINLY ON THE PLAINS"

sample.toLowerCase(); // "the rain in spain falls mainly on the plains"
```

## Undefined

A variable is `undefined` when it has been initialized, but not yet filled with a value.

```
console.log(bing); // Error, the variable bing doesn't exist

var bing;
console.log(bing); // The variable bing exists, but has not value
```
