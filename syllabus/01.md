# What is Javascript?

Javascript is an object-oriented scripting language. Javascript was designed to be embedded within web browsers, it cannot do anything on its own. Javascript can be used to communicate and modify the browser and the document.

Javascript is dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to define the type information going to a variable ahead of time. This also means you may change the variable type after it's been set.


```
var foobar = true; // foobar is a Boolean
var foobar = [];   // foobar is now an Array
var foobar = 100;  // foobar is now a Number
var foobar = "The quick brown fox"; // foobar is now a String
```

## Browser Object Model

The Browser Object Model, or BOM encompasses the current document, location, history, frames, and any other functionality the browser may expose to Javascript, starting with the `window` object. It is an informal term, not defined by any W3C or WHATWG standard and can change from one browser to the next.

The `window` object contains many properties, only a few are standardized (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#the-window-object). The `window` object also contains the `document` object.

To view everything contained in the BOM, enter `console.dir(window);` in the console.

## Document Object Model

The Document Object Model, or DOM is a web standard and is specific to the current HTML document. The DOM contains the `document` object, all its child nodes and methods.

To view everything contained in the DOM, enter `console.dir(document);` in the console.

# Using Javascript in a Document

Javascript may be placed anywhere in an HTML document. Javascript events may, but shouldn't be attached as attributes to HTML tags.

```
<a href="//github.com" onclick="function() { // Don't do this! };">GitHub</a>
```

 The `<script>` tag facilitates adding external Javascript files and block of code in the HTML.

 ```
 <html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
    <p>Putting Javascript in an HTML document</p>

    <script>
    var foo = "here is an inline script block";
    </script>

    <script src="/path/to/external/file.js"></script>
 </body>
 </html>
 ```

Loading a Javascript document blocks rendering of the HTML document. This means that while the Javascript is being loaded, the HTML document stops being parsed by your browser. To avoid this Microsoft introduced `defer` and HTML5 introduced `async`. Both properties come with conditions and neither works across all browsers. Whenever possible, `<script>` tags should be placed at the end of an HTML document.

# Testing Javascript

There are several ways to test Javascript in the browser. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all have Javascript consoles.

You can use Firebug in most browsers. Finally, there are online tools such as Codepen (http://codepen.io/pen).

# Variables

Variables are the most fundamental part of most programming languages. They are used to store and retrieve values, objects, and even functions.

```
var a_number = 1999;
var a_string = "This is a string";
var a_boolean = false;
var a_null = null;
var im_undefined;

var a_function = function( value ) {
    return value;
}
var an_array = ["nfl", "nba", "mlb", "mlg"];
var an_object = {
    football: "goal",
    baseball: "run",
    number: 9001,
    method: function() {
        return this.number;
    }
}
```

## Converting data types

Javascript is a dynamic language. This means that when you define a variable, you can redefine it with not only a different value, but a different type of data, and Javascript will not give you an error.

```
var large_number = 1e6;

large_number = "1 million";
```

Javascript being dynamically typed also means that you must be very aware of what data you put in a variable or you might get unexpected results. For example, if you have a number in a variable and concatenate a string to it, the data type becomes `string`.

```
var be_careful = 10;
typeof be_careful; // "number"

var be_careful = 10 + "bananas";
typeof be_careful; // "string"
```
