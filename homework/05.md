# Lesson 5 Exercises

1) Write a blog post about what you've learned in this lesson.

2) Create an array with all of the strings representing the NATO alphabet as elements. How would you determine the number of elements in this array?

3) Create an object with all of the letters and strings representing the NATO alphabet as properties and values.

4) Create a `Map` with all of the letters and strings representing the NATO alphabet as key/value pairs. How would you determine the number of keys in this `Map`?

5) Write a `switch` statement that accepts a letter as its input. For each letter, get and console log the appropriate NATO phonetic word.

6) Of `array`s, `object`s, `Map`s, and `Set`s, which do you think is most appropriate for storing the NATO alphabet? Why?

7) Convert the string "10001110101" to a number.
