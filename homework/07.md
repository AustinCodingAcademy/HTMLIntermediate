2) The Fibonacci Sequence are a collection of numbers where the last number is the sum of the two before it. The first two numbers in a Fibonacci Sequence are 0 and 1 and the first five are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3. Write a function named `fibonacci` that accepts an argument named `length`. The function should return an array of Fibonacci numbers and have as many numbers as length determines.

3) Write a function named `checkerboard` that accepts a `length` argument and two strings. The function should return a `length` x `length` checkerboard alternating the strings.
