# Lesson 6 Exercises

1) Write a program that console logs all the numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3, log the string 'Fizz' instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, log the string 'Buzz' instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log the string 'FizzBuzz'  instead of the number.

2) Create a variable that contains a string naming your favorite TV show. Then, using concatenation, insert that variable into the following statement:

"Dude, if you weren't aware, [insert name here] is, like, totally the greatest show on earth."

3) Write a program that fills an array named 'multiplicationTable' with a multiplication table from 0-12.

You should be able to call `multiplicationTable[5][5]` and get the value 25.

4) Write a program that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle

> ◣  
> ◣◣  
> ◣◣◣  
> ◣◣◣◣  
> ◣◣◣◣◣  
> ◣◣◣◣◣◣  
> ◣◣◣◣◣◣◣

5) Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a '⬜' or a '⬛' character. The characters should form a chess board.

When you `console.log` the string, you should see something like: 

> "  
> ⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛  
> ⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜  
> ⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛  
> ⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜  
> ⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛  
> ⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜  
> ⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛  
> ⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜  
> "

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable `size = 8` and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
