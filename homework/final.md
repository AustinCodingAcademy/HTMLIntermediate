# Final Project

## Create a TODO List App

As a user, I want to be able to create and complete TODO items. This app must include a text box and button where I can put text and press a button. When the button is pressed a new TODO item should be created and inserted into a list of items.

TODO list items should have a checkbox which will cross out the item when checked.

Use whatever styling you want to make it look nice too.
