# Midterm Project: Calculator

Write a program that performs a calculation, the minimum difficulty should be something along the lines of a body fat calculator, an interest calculator, etc.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Use JSDoc to describe how each function works (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc). Yes, this means that you will very likely have more comments than actual code.
- Also comment everything inside each function.
- Feel free to use `console.log` for debugging, but all functions should simply `return` calculated values
- The program should take into account the data passed into it. What should happen if the arguments are of the wrong type or left out entirely?
