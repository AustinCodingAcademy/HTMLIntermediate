# Midterm Project: Paper, Rock, Scissors

Write a function named `paperRockScossors` that accepts a single argument (called whatever you want). This argument should only accept 'paper', 'rock', or 'scissors' as arguments. Any other argument should cease the function and tell us what our options are. The function should randomly select one of the options as well and compare the two. The function should tell us what we and the function each selected and who won.

The result should be something like 'I selected rock and you selected paper. Looks like you won.'

Hint: You may need to look up `Math.random()` for this function.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Use JSDoc to describe how each function works (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc).
- Also comment everything inside each function. Yes, this means that you will very likely have more comments than actual code.
- Feel free to use `console.log` for debugging, but all functions should simply `return` calculated values
- The program should take into account the data passed into it. What should happen if the arguments are of the wrong type or left out entirely?
