# Lesson 8 Exercises

1) Write a blog post describing what was learned in this lesson

2) Create a class named `Vector` which represents a point on a two-dimensional chart. The `Vector` should have `x` and `y` properties. The `Vector` class should have a property named `length` with returns the distance from the vector to the origin (0,0). The `Vector` class should also have a method named `add` which accepts another `Vector` and add the `x` and `y` properties of the two `Vector`s and return a new `Vector` object.

Examples:

```javascript
const myFirstVector = new Vector(3, 4);
myFirstVector.x; // 3
myFirstVector.y; // 4
myFirstVector.length; // 5

const mySecondVector = new Vector(5, 6);
myFirstVector.x; // 5
myFirstVector.y; // 6
myFirstVector.length; // 7.81

const myLastVector = myFirstVector.add(mySecondVector);
myLastVector.x; // 8
myLastVector.y; // 10
myLastVector.length; // 12.80
```

3) Write a function that calculates interest based on the following formula, *A = P(1 + rt)* where:

- A = Total Accrued Amount (principal + interest)
- P = Principal Amount
- r = Rate of Interest per year in decimal; r = Interest percent/100
- t = Time Period involved in months or years

Example:

If `P = 10000`, `r = 3.875`, and `t = 5`, `A` should equal `11937.50`.

Output should be rounded to two decimal places.
