# Classes

**Goal:** In this lesson, we will learn about Classes. We'll also look at JavaScript modules, and how functions, classes, and modules are used to organize code in modern JavaScript.

# What are Classes

Let's take a moment to think about the automobile. Automobiles all share many features and many automobiles have unique features. Automobiles as a group share a common blueprint. *Class*es serve as a way to define that blueprint in a programming language. Classes provide a way to template and combine all the code needed to create or do a thing. In most of the following examples, we'll use Automobiles as that "thing".

# Before ES6 (The Dark Ages)

Before ES6 came along, vanilla JavaScript used functions and prototypes to construct classes. This is very different from nearly every other language that used the `class` keyword to define classes. There were libraries such as *CoffeeScript* that implemented a way to write classes, but we won't dive into that.

Let's look at how classes used to be set up.

## Constructors

The *constructor* is a function called when a new instance of a class is created. Let's look at how a constructor works pre-ES6.

```javascript
// This is all in the pre-ES6 syntax style
function Automobile(make, firstYear) {
    this.make = make;
    this.firstYear = firstYear;
}
```

"Wait, Rob", I hear you saying, "that's just a function". Looks like it. You will notice we pass several arguments to that function and inside, we use `this` along with what looks much like an object's dot syntax. An instance of a class is an object and has properties just like an object. `this` references the specific instance of a class. Let's explore what that means and how to call constructors.

```javascript
var Miata = new Automobile('Mazda', 1989);
var Mustang = new Automobile('Ford', 1964);
```

Above, both the Miata and the Mustang are instances of the `Automobile` class. In the case of the Miata, `this` is the Miata, and in the case of the Mustang, `this` is the Mustang. However, `this` is only important within a class. Once an instance of a class is created, we can access its properties just like those of a normal class.

```javascript
console.log(Miata.firstYear);
// 1989

console.log(Mustang.make);
// Ford
```

## Methods

Classes can have functions, however we call them *methods*. We can add methods to a constructor by extending its `prototype`. `prototype` is an object that all functions contain. Any object that is an instance of a function also has the same `prototype`. A class' prototype includes its constructor. Let's look at how to add a method to a constructor.

```javascript
Automobile.prototype.start = function() {
    return 'Vroom, vroom!';
};
```

Now, with any instance of `Automobile`, we can call the `start()` method.

```javascript
Miata.start();
// "Vroom, vroom!"
```

We can also call it on `Automobile`.

```javascript
Automobile.prototype.start();
// "Vroom, vroom!"
```

## Extending Classes

An automobile is pretty good, but motorcycles are what all the cool kids like. Motorcycles share much with automobiles, yet have several unique traits. Now that we know how to create constructors and add methods, let's make a bigger Automobile class and then make a Motorcycle class that extends it.

```javascript
function Automobile(make, model, color) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;

    this._doorCount = 4;
    this._doorsLocked = true;
}

Automobile.prototype.lockUnlock = function() {
    if (this._doorsLocked) {
        this._doorsLocked = false;
        return 'Doors unlocked';
    }

    this._doorsLocked = true;
    return 'Doors locked';
};

Object.defineProperty(Automobile.prototype, 'doors', {
    get: function() {
        return this._doorCount;
    },
    set: function(number) {
        this._doorCount = number;
    }
});

Object.defineProperty(Automobile.prototype, 'name', {
    get: function() {
        return this.make + ' ' + this.model;
    }
});

function Motorcycle(make, model, color) {
    Automobile.call(this, make, model, color);

    delete this._doorCount;
    delete this._doorsLocked;
}

Motorcycle.prototype = Object.create(Automobile.prototype);

Motorcycle.prototype.lockUnlock = function() {
    return 'Motorcycles have no doors';
};

Object.defineProperty(Motorcycle.prototype, 'doors', {
    get: function() {
        return 0;
    }
});

var hondaCivic = new Automobile('Honda', 'Civic', 'Silver');
hondaCivic.color;
// Silver
hondaCivic.name;
// "Honda Civic"
hondaCivic.doors;
// 4

var hondaRebel = new Motorcycle('Honda', 'Rebel', 'Black');
hondaRebel.color;
// Black
hondaRebel.name;
// "Honda Rebel"
hondaRebel.doors;
// "Motorcycles have no doors"
```

*Instructor should cover the following topics:*

- Properties: public and private
- `Object.defineProperty`
- getters and setters
- `Function.prototype.call()`
