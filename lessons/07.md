# Functions

# Pre-class Preparations

* [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
* [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
* [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)

Create a new folder called *functions* and files called *index.html* and *functions.js* and set up new *package.json*, *gulpfile.js*, and *.eslintrc.

# Creating Functions

## Reserved Words

JavaScript has many words we cannot use for function names, these words include:

```javascript
abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in, instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, transient, try, typeof, var, void, volatile, while, with, yield
```

# Invoking Functions

# Scope

# Anonymous Functions

# IIFEs

# Fat Arrow Functions

# Array methods

There are several types of loops built right into Arrays.

## forEach

`forEach` is an array method that lets us iterate using a function.

```javascript
favoriteTVShows.forEach((show) => {
    console.log(show);
});
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Use a `forEach` loop to iterate your array, logging each individual element.
> 1. Compare `forEach` loops with the `for`, `while`, and `for..of` loops, which do you think is easier to read?
> 1. `forEach` loops also only iterate in one direction, can you think of a way to effectively iterate from 10 to 0 backwards?
