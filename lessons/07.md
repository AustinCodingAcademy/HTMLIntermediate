Create a new folder called *functions* and files called *index.html* and *functions.js* and set up new *package.json*, *gulpfile.js*, and *.eslintrc.

# Creating Functions

Now that we have seen `boolean`s, `string`s, `number`s, `array`s, `object`s, `Map`s and `Set`s, we need to figure out a way to organize and make our code reusable. Functions provide us a way to reuse code. This is a principle called *DRY*, or *Don't Repeat Yourself*. If you find yourself writing something, and writing it again, its a good candidate for being wrapped in a function.

We define functions with the `function` keyword and by giving the function a name. Before we start creating functions, we need to know what names we *cannot* use.

## Reserved Words

JavaScript has many words we cannot use for function names, these words include:

> abstract, await, async, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in, instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, transient, try, typeof, var, void, volatile, while, with, yield

## Function declarations

Let's now look at how a function is defined using the declarative style.

```javascript
function welcome() {}
```

## Function variables

We can also define a function as a variable.

```javascript
let welcome = function() {};
```

## Invoking functions

We can *call* or *invoke* a function by using its name and and a pair of parentheses.

```javascript
// Define a function
functions welcome() {
    console.log('Welcome to JavaScript.');
}

// Call that function
welcome(); // Welcome to JavaScript.
```

## Arguments

Functions accept 0 or more *arguments* within the parentheses. Arguments are like variables that are passed into the function to be used. They can be thought of as settings that the function accepts to modify its behavior.

```javascript
function log(message) {
    console.log(message);
}

log('Hello, I am in your console.'); // Hello, I am in your console.
log('This is weird, let me out.'); // This is weird, let me out.
```

In this preceding example, the function `log` accepts one argument and that argument is passed to `console.log`. Its often a good idea to define variables within a function from arguments, for example if the function expects a number, we should make sure that the value being used within is one.

```javascript
function addFour(value) {
    let value = Number(value); // Cast `value` as a number, just in case.

    return value + 4;
}

addFour(10); // 14
addFour("10"); // 14
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. What would the result of the two function calls above be if we didn't convert `value` to a number?

Functions can of course accept more than one arguments.

```javascript
function add(number1, number2) {
    let number1 = Number(number1);
    let number2 = Number(number2);

    return number1 + number2;
}

add(5, 10); // 15
```

## The rest parameter

Let's return to the idea of adding up numbers. The `add` function above accepts 2 arguments that are added together. What do we do if we want to add three arguments? Or four? Or if we don't know how many we want? JavaScript provides us the *rest parameter* which accepts any number of values and passes along an array.

```javascript
function logEach(...values) {
    for(let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
        console.log(values[i]);
    }
}

logEach(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Write a function that multiplies two numbers and logs the result to the console.
> 2. Write a function that multiplies many numbers and logs the result to the console.

# Scope

# Anonymous Functions

# IIFEs

# Fat Arrow Functions

# Array methods

There are several types of loops built right into Arrays.

## forEach

`forEach` is an array method that lets us iterate using a function.

```javascript
favoriteTVShows.forEach((show) => {
    console.log(show);
});
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Use a `forEach` loop to iterate your array, logging each individual element.
> 1. Compare `forEach` loops with the `for`, `while`, and `for..of` loops, which do you think is easier to read?
> 1. `forEach` loops also only iterate in one direction, can you think of a way to effectively iterate from 10 to 0 backwards?
