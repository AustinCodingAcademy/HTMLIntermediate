# Functions

# Pre-class Preparations

Create a new folder called *functions* and files called *index.html* and *functions.js* and set up new *package.json*, *gulpfile.js*, and *.eslintrc.

# Functions

Now that we have seen `boolean`s, `string`s, `number`s, `array`s, `object`s, `Map`s and `Set`s, we need to figure out a way to organize and make our code reusable. Functions provide us a way to reuse code. This is a principle called *DRY*, or *Don't Repeat Yourself*. If you find yourself writing something, and writing it again, its a good candidate for being wrapped in a function.

# Creating Functions

We define functions with the `function` keyword and by giving the function a name. Before we start creating functions, we need to know what names we *cannot* use.

## Reserved Words

JavaScript has many words we cannot use for function names, these words include:

```javascript
abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in, instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, transient, try, typeof, var, void, volatile, while, with, yield
```

## Function declarations

Let's now look at how a function is defined using the declarative style.

```javascript
function welcome() {}
```

## Function variables

We can also define a function as a variable.

```javascript
let welcome = function() {};
```

# Scope

# Anonymous Functions

# IIFEs

# Fat Arrow Functions

# Array methods

There are several types of loops built right into Arrays.

## forEach

`forEach` is an array method that lets us iterate using a function.

```javascript
favoriteTVShows.forEach((show) => {
    console.log(show);
});
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Use a `forEach` loop to iterate your array, logging each individual element.
> 1. Compare `forEach` loops with the `for`, `while`, and `for..of` loops, which do you think is easier to read?
> 1. `forEach` loops also only iterate in one direction, can you think of a way to effectively iterate from 10 to 0 backwards?
