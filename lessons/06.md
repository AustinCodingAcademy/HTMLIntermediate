# Loops and Iteration

**Goal:** In this lesson, we will learn about iteration and how to loop through different types of data.

When we have a collection of data, possibly in the form of an array, an object, a Map or, a Set, we often want to do something with *each* element. In many of the examples that follow, we will just `console.log()` individual elements, however we could easily be dynamically inserting elements into a web page or doing some other thing that I cannot currently think of.

JavaScript has the concept of arrays and array-like constructs. We've already seen arrays, but array-likes are probably new to you. If we were to use `document.querySelectorAll()` to collect several web page or more correctly, *DOM*, elements, we'd get back an array-like collection. We can convert those to actual arrays, and we'll see how to do that in a later lesson.

I will start this lesson by creating an array that I'll use in the code examples. I'll have you create your own shortly.

```javascript
let favoriteTVShows = [
    'Adventure Time',
    'Better Call Saul',
    'Bob\'s Burgers',
    'King of the Hill',
    'Parks and Recreation',
    'Portlandia',
    'Regular Show',
    'Sarah & Duck',
    'Steven Universe',
    'The Office',
    'Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp',
];
```

## For

A `for` statement is the most explicitly constructed sort of loop. In a `for` loop, we have to specifically define:

- the *initial state*
- the *condition* that must remain true to continue to run the loop
- the *final expression* that will be evaluated after everything else in the loop

as arguments in the `for` loop statement. Let's look at a loop,

```javascript
for(let i = 1; i < 11; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9
// 10
```

In this example, we want to simply output the numbers from 1 to 10, so we set the initial value `i` to 1. Then, we state that as long as `i` is less than 11, the loop will continue to run. Finally, after we've done everything in the loop (in this case, just `console.log()`), we increment `i`.

Now, let's look at a slightly more complicated example, the goal of this loop is to output each element in my `favoriteTVShows` array.

```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < favoriteTVShows.length; i++) {
    console.log(favoriteTVShows[i]);
}
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Based on what you know about `for` loops, let's explain what is happening in this loop.
> 1. Create your own array of data and log each item within.
> 1. Create a loop that counts down from 10 to 0, inclusive.
> 1. Using the same array, loop through the data *backwards* and log each item.

## While

While (*heh*) the `for` loop requires we define all the parameters as arguments, a `while` loop only requires the truth condition. Let's take a look:

```javascript
let i = 1;

while(i < 11) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
```

I can do the same with my personal array from above:

```javascript
let i = 0;

while(i < favoriteTVShows.length) {
    console.log(favoriteTVShows[i]);
    i++;
}
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Let's explain the last `while` loop, line by line.
> 1. Use a `while` loop to iterate your array, logging each individual element.
> 1. Use a `while` loop to iterate from 10 to 0 backwards.
> 1. Use a `while` loop to iterate your array backwards.
> 1. Compare `for` loops with `while` loops, which do you think is easier to read?

## For..of

ES6 provides us a new way to iterate any iterable object, such as arrays, sets, and maps, `for..of`. Let's iterate through our favorite TV shows.

```javascript
for (let show of favoriteTVShows) {
    console.log(show);
}
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Use a `for..of` loop to iterate your array, logging each individual element.
> 1. Compare `for..of` loops with the `for` and `while` loops, which do you think is easier to read?
> 1. `for..of` loops only iterate in one direction, can you think of a way to effectively iterate from 10 to 0 backwards?

# Arrays, revisited

*Time allowing, the instructor will cover the following methods, providing examples and allowing exercise time for each:*

- `String.split()`
- `Array.join()`
- `Array.reverse()`
- `Array.sort()`

# Assessment

Use the following array for each of the following exercises.

```javascript
const alphabet = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l','m','n','o','p','q','r','s','t','u','v','w','x','y','z'];
```

1. Write a `for` loop that iterates through the `alphabet` array and console logs each element.
1. Write a `while` loop that iterates through the `alphabet` array and console logs each element.
1. Write a `for..of` loop that iterates through the `alphabet` array and console logs each element.

# Exercises

1) Write a program that console logs all the numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3, log the string 'Fizz' instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, log the string 'Buzz' instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log the string 'FizzBuzz'  instead of the number.

2) Create a variable that contains a string naming your favorite TV show. Then, using concatenation, insert that variable into the following statement:

"Dude, if you weren't aware, [insert name here] is, like, totally the greatest show on earth."

3) Write a program that fills an array named 'multiplicationTable' with a multiplication table from 0-12.

![multiplication table](http://www.happalmer.com/MM%20Images/Table.jpg)

You should be able to call `multiplicationTable[5][5]` and get the value 25.

4) Write a program that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle

> ◣  
> ◣◣  
> ◣◣◣  
> ◣◣◣◣  
> ◣◣◣◣◣  
> ◣◣◣◣◣◣  
> ◣◣◣◣◣◣◣

5) Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a '⬜' or a '⬛' character. The characters should form a chess board.

When you `console.log` the string, you should see something like: 

> "  
> ⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛  
> ⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜  
> ⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛  
> ⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜  
> ⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛  
> ⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜  
> ⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛  
> ⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜  
> "

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable `size = 8` and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
