When we have a collection of data, possibly in the form of an array, an object, a Map or, a Set, we often want to do something with *each* element. In many of the examples that follow, we will just `console.log()` individual elements, however we could easily be dynamically inserting elements into a web page or doing some other thing that I cannot currently think of. 

JavaScript has the concept of arrays and array-like constructs. We've already seen arrays, but array-likes are probably new to you. If we were to use `document.querySelectorAll()` to collect several web page or more correctly, *DOM*, elements, we'd get back an array-like collection. We can convert those to actual arrays, and we'll see how to do that in a later lesson.

Let's start this lesson by creating an array and an object that we'll use in the code examples.

```javascript
let favoriteTVShows = [
    'Better Call Saul',
    'Bob\'s Burgers',
    'King of the Hill',
    'Parks and Recreation',
    'Portlandia',
    'Regular Show',
    'Sarah & Duck',
    'Steven Universe',
    'The Office',
    'Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp',
];
```

## For

A `for` statement is the most explicitly constructed sort of loop. In a `for` loop, we have to specifically set 

- the *initial state*
- the *condition* that must remain true to continue to run the loop
- the *final expression* that will be evaluated after everything else in the loop

Let's look at a loop,

```javascript
for(let i = 1; i < 11; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9
// 10
```

In this example, we want to simply output the numbers from 1 to 10, so we set the initial value `i` to 1. Then, we state that as long as `i` is less than 11, the loop will continue to run. Finally, after we've done everything in the loop (in this case, just `console.log()`), we increment `i`.

Now, let's look at a slightly more complicated example, the goal of this loop is to output each element in my `favoriteTVShows` array.

```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < favoriteTVShows.length; i++) {
    console.log(favoriteTVShows[i]);
}
```
