# Loops and Iteration

**Goal:** In this lesson, we will learn about iteration and how to loop through different types of data.

When we have a collection of data, possibly in the form of an array, an object, a Map or, a Set, we often want to do something with *each* element. In many of the examples that follow, we will just `console.log()` individual elements, however we could easily be dynamically inserting elements into a web page or doing some other thing that I cannot currently think of.

JavaScript has the concept of arrays and array-like constructs. We've already seen arrays, but array-likes are probably new to you. If we were to use `document.querySelectorAll()` to collect several web page or more correctly, *DOM*, elements, we'd get back an array-like collection. We can convert those to actual arrays, and we'll see how to do that in a later lesson.

I will start this lesson by creating an array that I'll use in the code examples. I'll have you create your own shortly.

```javascript
let favoriteTVShows = [
    'Adventure Time',
    'Better Call Saul',
    'Bob\'s Burgers',
    'King of the Hill',
    'Parks and Recreation',
    'Portlandia',
    'Regular Show',
    'Sarah & Duck',
    'Steven Universe',
    'The Office',
    'Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp',
];
```

## For

A `for` statement is the most explicitly constructed sort of loop. In a `for` loop, we have to specifically define:

- the *initial state*
- the *condition* that must remain true to continue to run the loop
- the *final expression* that will be evaluated after everything else in the loop

as arguments in the `for` loop statement. Let's look at a loop,

```javascript
for(let i = 1; i < 11; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9
// 10
```

In this example, we want to simply output the numbers from 1 to 10, so we set the initial value `i` to 1. Then, we state that as long as `i` is less than 11, the loop will continue to run. Finally, after we've done everything in the loop (in this case, just `console.log()`), we increment `i`.

Now, let's look at a slightly more complicated example, the goal of this loop is to output each element in my `favoriteTVShows` array.

```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < favoriteTVShows.length; i++) {
    console.log(favoriteTVShows[i]);
}
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Based on what you know about `for` loops, let's explain what is happening in this loop.
> 1. Create your own array of data and log each item within.
> 1. Create a loop that counts down from 10 to 0, inclusive.
> 1. Using the same array, loop through the data *backwards* and log each item.

## While

While (*heh*) the `for` loop requires we define all the parameters as arguments, a `while` loop only requires the truth condition. Let's take a look:

```javascript
let i = 1;

while(i < 11) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
```

I can do the same with my personal array from above:

```javascript
let i = 0;

while(i < favoriteTVShows.length) {
    console.log(favoriteTVShows[i]);
    i++;
}
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Let's explain the last `while` loop, line by line.
> 1. Use a `while` loop to iterate your array, logging each individual element.
> 1. Use a `while` loop to iterate from 10 to 0 backwards.
> 1. Use a `while` loop to iterate your array backwards.
> 1. Compare `for` loops with `while` loops, which do you think is easier to read?

## For..of

ES6 provides us a new way to iterate any iterable object, such as arrays, sets, and maps, `for..of`. Let's iterate through our favorite TV shows.

```javascript
for (let show of favoriteTVShows) {
    console.log(show);
}
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Use a `for..of` loop to iterate your array, logging each individual element.
> 1. Compare `for..of` loops with the `for` and `while` loops, which do you think is easier to read?
> 1. `for..of` loops only iterate in one direction, can you think of a way to effectively iterate from 10 to 0 backwards?

# Exercises

1) Write a loop that console logs all the numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3, also log the string 'Fizz'. If the number is divisible by 5, log the string 'Buzz'. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log the string 'FizzBuzz'.

2) Create a variable that contains a string naming your favorite TV show. Then, using concatenation, insert that variable into the following statement:
    "Dude, if you weren't aware, [insert name here] is, like, totally the greatest show on earth."

3) Write a loop that creates an array that contains a multiplication table.
