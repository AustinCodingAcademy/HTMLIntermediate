## Node.js

**Node.js** is a web platform built on Google's JavaScript engine, V8. It provides a way to run a web server virtual machine via JavaScript. As a result, front-end developers can with relative ease, create full-stack web applications in JavaScript and write both front- and back end code in a language they already know.

Find out more at: https://nodejs.org/.

## NPM

**NPM** or the Node Package Manger is a tool that empowers a developer or team of developers to maintain and define JavaScript plugins and utilities and their dependencies.

Browse all the plugins here: https://www.npmjs.com/.

## Gulp

Gulp.js is a work-flow automation tool. It provides an API for defining tasks such as moving or renaming files and running other plugins such as Babel, Browserfy, Karma, Sass, and image optimization on a variety of files.

Check it out at: http://gulpjs.com/

## Babel

Babel is a JavaScript compiler, it says so right on their website. Babel allows programmers to write future-facing and presently standard JavaScript and compile it down to code that will work on nearly any browser, regardless of support for current trends.

See it here: https://babeljs.io/

# Setting up a Workstation for Developing Modern Code

Install Node.js via the installer available at https://nodejs.org

Create a folder.

In the command line, go to that folder and run the following command:

```bash
npm init
```

Follow the on screen wizard.

Let's take a look at *package.json*.

Next, lets install some plugins. In the command line, enter the following commands,

```bash
npm install --save gulp
npm install --save gulp-sourcemaps
npm install --save gulp-babel
npm install --save gulp-watch
```

or just this command,

```bash
npm install --save gulp gulp-sourcemaps gulp-babel gulp-watch
```

Next, in the root of our folder, let's create a file and call it `gulpfile.js` and lets add the following code.

```javascript
// Source of gulpfile.js

var gulp       = require('gulp');
var babel      = require('gulp-babel');
var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');

gulp.task('babel', function () {
    return gulp.src("src/**/*.js")
        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
        .pipe(babel())
        .pipe(sourcemaps.write())
        .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"))
    ;
});

gulp.task('default', ['babel'], function() {});
```

In our gulpfile, we start by importing several modules (*We'll learn more about JavaScript modules in a few weeks*) and storing them in variables. Then, we create a new task named `babel` that looks at all the files in all the folders in the *src* directory.  For each file found the following four steps are followed:

1. Gulp initializes *sourcemaps*. Sourcemaps are use to map specific lines of code in one file to their respective code in a different file. This is important because when we *transpile* the code with babel, the code is often changing. If there is an error in the transpiled code, we want to know where in the source code that error came from.
2. Gulp *babel*ifies the code, generating a new file with the transpiled code.
3. Gulp creates the sourcemap and appends it to the generated file.
4. Gulp saves the generated file with the same name and path as the original, except in the *dist* directory instead of in *src*.

We create another task named 'default'. The 'default' task is dependent on 'babel' completing. If there are no errors, the callback function will run, in this case, we leave it blank.

Let's see this in action. In the command line, run the command,

```bash
gulp
```

and you should see something similar to,

```bash
[22:00:49] Using gulpfile gulpfile.js
[22:00:49] Starting 'babel'...
[22:00:49] Finished 'babel' after 9.72 ms
[22:00:49] Starting 'default'...
[22:00:49] Finished 'default' after 9.95 Î¼s
```

Next let's create a new JavaScript file called *src/test.js* and add some code. 

```javascript
let name = 'Rob';
```

Run the `gulp` command again and let's see what happens.

We *should* see similar output from before, but now, if we look at our file system, we should also see a new folder titled 'dist'. Inside that folder, let's compare that version of *test.js* to the one in src.

Isn't this great?

Let's make it greater. If I haven't mentioned it yet, I'll tell you now that great programmers are lazy, meaning we try not to repeat ourselves too many times. We don't want to manually run `gulp` each time we add a or modify a file, so let's set up a *watch* task.

Back in our gulpfile, let's add a new function,

```javascript
gulp.task('watch', function() {
    gulp.watch('src/**/*.js', ['babel']);
});
```

The *watch* task does just one thing, it watches the specified files and folders for any changes and when something does change, the *babel* task is run.

Next, we'll add new array element to the default task.

```javascript
gulp.task('default', ['babel', 'watch'], function() {});
```

If we've done everything correctly, when we run `gulp` next, the process will not terminate and any file we add or modify will automatically be processed. (If you want to manually end the process, just press `control + c`).

*Instructor will take class through a few coding exercises to verify everything works here.*

# Linting Our Code

Linting our code allows us to define specific rules we want to abide by as we code. A fully linted file ensures every developer touching a file follows the same basic rules about how they format their code.

First, let's install a few more modules:

```bash
npm install --save eslint gulp-eslint
```

Let's verify that `eslint` is installed correctly, enter the following command:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/eslint --v
```

If it worked, we should see a version number, probably something similar to `v1.3.1`.

Next, let's create an *.eslintrc* file. The *.eslintrc* file lists all the rules we determine we want to follow. We create the *.eslintrc* by running the following command in the command line and following the wizard we are presented:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
```

We should see the *.eslintrc* in our file system now. Let's take a few minutes to explore the file.

Back in our gulpfile, we need to add some more stuff. First, let's import the `gulp-eslint` module.

```javascript
var gulp       = require('gulp');
var babel      = require('gulp-babel');
var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');
var eslint     = require('gulp-eslint');

...
```

Now, let's create a new task to perform the linting.

```javascript
gulp.task('lint', function() {
    return gulp.src(['src/**/*.js'])
        .pipe(eslint())
        .pipe(eslint.formatEach('compact'))
        .pipe(eslint.failAfterError())
    ;
});
```

Next, we will add the *lint* task to the *default* task and make the babel task dependent on its completing without errors.

```javascript
...

gulp.task('babel', ['lint'], function () {
    // contents not changing
});

...

gulp.task('default', ['lint', 'babel', 'watch'], function() {});
```

Let's run `gulp` in the command line again. We should get some `ESLintError`s.

*Instructor will address any problems that aren't ESLintErrors, then work with the class to demonstrate adding new rules and addressing the errors given.*
