# What is JavaScript?

- In 1995 Netscape published the first version of JavaScript and it was compatible with Netscape Navigator.
- To avoid potential patent issues with Sun Microsystems and their trademark on 'Java', Microsoft published JScript in 1996 for Internet Explorer.

# Primitives Data Types

In JavaScript there are 6 primitive data types.

- Boolean
- Null
- Number
- String
- Symbol
- Undefined

Primitives have no methods and are not objects, don't worry, we'll cover what this means soon enough.

## Boolean

A **boolean** is a logical data type that can have only the values `true` or `false`.

We can define booleans using literal syntax.

```javascript
var f = false;
var t = true;
```

We use booleans to conditionally run block of code (more on that later).

```javascript
var f = false;
if (f) {
    // Code in here will not run
}

var t = true;
if (t) {
    // Code in here will run
}
```

We can also define booleans using their wrapper syntax. **There is never actually a reason to do this though.** Here, the value of `b` is an object and not immediately useful. We access the value of a primitive defined this way by invoking the `valueOf()` method.

```javascript
var b = new Boolean(true);
b.valueOf(); // true
```

We can convert values to boolean by using `Boolean` as a function.

```javascript
// All True
Boolean(true);
Boolean(1);
Boolean(-1);
Boolean('Hello Guys');
Boolean('');
Boolean({});
Boolean([]);

// All False
Boolean(false);
Boolean();
Boolean(0);
Boolean(NaN);
Boolean(null);
Boolean(undefined);
```

## Null

The primitive value `null` represents an empty value. A variable with the value `null` exists, but it explicitly without value.

```javascript
var n = null;
```

---

## Number

**Numbers** are... numbers? Unlike some other languages, JavaScript doesn't differentiate between integer and decimal numbers.

We can define numbers using literal syntax.

```javascript
var integer  = 100;
var negative = -15;
var decimal  = 3.14;
```
