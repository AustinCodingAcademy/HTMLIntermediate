# Conditionals and Comparisons

Frequently as developers, we need to make decisions based on data we are given. We may or may not know what that data will look like, but we can account for many possibilities.

In this lesson, we will learn about several types of operators, control flow, and how to use them together.

# Pre-class Preperations

Create a new folder called *conditions* and files called *index.html* and *conditions.js* and set up new *package.json*, *gulpfile.js*, and *.eslintrc.

# Operators

JavaScript supports a number of operators and all operators are a type of expression, again meaning that they produce a value.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign a value to the left side operand based on the value of the right hand operand. The most basic form of this is `x = y` where the value of `y` is assigned to `x`.

| Name                      | Shorthand operator | Meaning   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Assignment                | x = y              | x = y     |
| Addition assignment       | x += y             | x = x + y |
| Subtraction assignment    | x -= y             | x = x - y |
| Multiplication assignment | x *= y             | x = x * y |
| Division assignment       | x /= y             | x = x / y |
| Remainder assignment      | x %= y             | x = x % y |

#### Exercise Break!

> Let's work on some assignment operators. Assuming `x` is 9 and `y` is 3, what do the following evaluate to?
> 
> 1. x = y
> 2. x += y
> 3. x -= y
> 4. x *= y
> 5. x /= y
> 6. x %= y

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare its operands and return a boolean value based on that comparison. Whenever possible, the operators will be converted to be of the some type for comparison.

| Operator | Description | Example expressions returning `true` | Example expressions returning `false` |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Equal (`==`) | Returns `true` if the operands are equal | `5 == '5'` | `5 == 3` |
| Not equal (`!=`) | Returns `true` if the operands are not equal | `5 != 3` | `5 != '5'` |
| Strict equal (`===`) | Returns `true` if the operands are equal and of the same type | `5 === 5` | `5 === '5'` |
| Strict not equal (`!==`) | Returns `true` if either the operands are not equal or not of the same type | `5 !== '5'` | `5 !== 5` |
| Greater than (`>`) | Returns `true` if the left operand is greater than the right operand | `5 > 3` | `5 > 8` |
| Greater than or equal (`>=`) | Returns `true` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand | `5 >= 3` | `5 >= 8` |
| Less than (`<`) | Returns `true` if the left operand is less than the right operand | `5 < 8` | `5 < 3` |
| Less than or equal (`<=`) | Returns `true` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand | `5 <= 8` | `5 <= 3` |

#### Exercise Break!

> Let's work on some comparison operators. What do the following evaluate to?
> 
> 1.  `9 == 9`
> 2.  `9 == '9'`
> 3.  `9 != 9`
> 4.  `9 != '9'`
> 5.  `9 === 9`
> 6.  `9 === '9'`
> 7.  `9 !== 9`
> 8.  `9 !== '9'`
> 9.  `9 > 5`
> 10. `9 >= 8`
> 11. `9 < 100`
> 12. `9 <= 9`

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators accept an numerical value as an operand on either side and return a numerical value. The basic arithmetic operators are addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

In addition to these operators, JavaScript provides,

| Operator | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Remainder (`%`) | Binary operator. Returns the integer remainder of dividing two operands | `8 % 3` returns `2` |
| Increment (`++`) | Unary operator. Adds one to its operand. If used as a prefix operator (`++x`), returns the value of its operand after adding one; if used as a postfix operator (`x++`), returns the value of its operand before adding one. | If `x` is `3`, then `++x` sets `x` to `4` and returns `4`, whereas `x++` returns `3` and, only then, sets `x` to `4`. |
| Decrement (`--`) | Unary operator. Subtracts one from its operand. The return pattern is similar to the increment operator. | If `x` is `3`, then `--x` sets `x` to `2` and returns `2`, whereas `x--` returns `3` and, only then, sets `x` to `2`. |
| Unary Negation (`-`) | Unary operator. Returns the negation of the value | If `x` is `3`, then `-x` is `-3` |
| Unary Plus (`+`) | Attempts to convert the operand to a number, if it isn't already. | `+'7` returns `7`, `+true` returns `1` |
| Exponent Operator (`**`) | *This is EcmaScript 6 only.* Raises the left operand to a power equal to the right operand | `3 ** 4` returns `81` |

#### Exercise Break!

> 
> 1. `12 % 5`
> 2. `7 % 7`
> 3. `9++`
> 4. `++9`
> 5. `9--`
> 6. `--9`
> 7. `-10`
> 8. `+'100'`
> 9. `4 ** 2`

## Logical Operators

Logical Operators return one of its operands depending on its truthyness.

| Operator | Usage | Description |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| AND (`&&`) | `leftExpression && rightExpression` | Returns `leftExpression` if it converts to `false`, otherwise returns `rightExpression`. |
| OR (`||`) | `leftExpression || rightExpression` | Returns `leftExpression` if it converts to `true`, otherwise returns `rightExpression` |
| NOT (`!`) | `! expression` | Returns `false` is the operand converts to `true`, otherwise returns `true` |

#### Exercise Break!

> Let's evaluate some operators, what would the following return?
> 
> 1.  `5 + 5 && 1 + 2`
> 2.  `3 - 6 && 4 + 4`
> 3.  `5 - 5 && 3 + 5`
> 4.  `4 < 7 && 5 < 6`
> 5.  `4 > 7 && 5 < 6`
> 6.  `4 > 7 && 5 > 6`
> 7.  `4 < 7 && 5 > 6`
> 8.  `5 + 5 || 1 + 2`
> 9.  `3 - 6 || 4 + 4`
> 10. `5 - 5 || 3 + 5`
> 11. `4 < 7 || 5 < 6`
> 12. `4 > 7 || 5 < 6`
> 13. `4 > 7 || 5 > 6`
> 14. `4 < 7 || 5 > 6`
> 15. `! 5 == '5'`
> 16. `! 5 === '5'`
> 17. `! 5 != '5'`

# Control Flow Statements

We use operators and expressions to determine whether or not code will execute within control flow statements. Control flow statements contain code grouped in a code block delimited by curly braces `{` and `}`. Let's look at a block statement in action.

```javascript
{
    let name = 'Ziggy Stardust';
    console.log(`${name} and the Spiders from Mars.`);
}
```

Code within a block will execute as soon as our program arrives at it, unless of course, we use flow control to alter the course of its execution. Let's look at how we do that now.

## If

One of the most simple of flow control statements is the `if` statement. We use it to set a condition which must convert to `true` to run.

```javascript
if ( expression ) { /* statements to run */ }
```

Let's look at an example of how to use `if` statements to set a variable.

```javascript
let someNumber = 10;
let myName = 'Clark Kent';

if (someNumber > 100) {
    myName = 'Superman';
}

console.log(myName);
```

Here, we set two variables, `someNumber` and `myName`. In the event that `someNumber` is greater than 100, we change the value of `myName` within the code block. in this case, that change never happens.

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. What could we change in the preceding code example to redefine `myName` to 'Superman'?
> 2. Let's practice using different expressions to generate output (or not) in `if` statements. (10 minutes)

---

## If..else

In the previous example, we execute some code if an expression evaluates to `true`. There are also situations where we might want to perform some other code if the expression is not truthy.

```javascript
let disguised = true;

if (disguised === true) {
    console.log('I am Batman.');
} else {
    console.log('I am Bruce Wayne.');
}
```

In this example, if we are disguised, then we'll see 'I am Batman.' in the console output, but if we aren't disguised, we'll see 'I am Bruce Wayne.' instead.

#### Exercise Break!

> Starting with the statement `let rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*10);`, write an `if...else` statement that logs to the console the value of `rand` when it is between 0 and 4 and logs to the console the string 'Awesome!' when the value is between 5 and 9.

---

## If..elseif

With an `if` statement, statements in the code block only run if the expression evaluates to `true`. When we add an `else` statement, the statements in that block will only run if the expression is `false`. Sometimes, we want to test several expressions and we use `elseif` statements to achieve this.

```javascript
let time,
    day = 'Monday';

if (day === 'Saturday' || day === 'Sunday') {
    time = 'Party time!';
} else if (day === 'Wednesday') {
    time = 'Hump day.';
} else {
    time = 'Work time.';
}

console.log(`Its ${ day }, that means it is ${ time }`);
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Explain what happened in that last example.
> 2. Comment your code describing what happened.
> 3. Write an `if..elseif` statement describing the things you might do each day of the week.
> 3. Let's practice using different expressions to generate output (or not) in `if..else` and `if..elseif` statements. (15 minutes).

---

## Conditional (ternary) Operator

A *ternary operator* or *ternary statement* is a short-hand version of an `if..else` statement. It is commonly used to give a single variable one of two values depending on the truthyness of an expression.

```javascript
let ternary = (expression) ? 'true value' : 'false value';
```

Looking back to our Batman `if..else` statement above, we could shorten it to look like:

```javascript
let disguised = true;
// Pattern: variable assignment = expression ? value if truthy : value if falsey;
let whoAmI = (disguised === true) ? 'Batman' : 'Bruce Wayne';
console.log(`I am ${ whoAmI }.`);
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Starting with `let rando = Math.random();`, write a ternary expression that assigns to a variable the string 'Yes' when rando < 0.5 and 'No' otherwise.
> 2. Can you think of any times where we would want a ternary operator instead of an `if..else` statement?

---

## Switch Statements

Sometimes, we have many `if..else` statements. When we do, we might consider using a `switch` statement instead. A `switch` statement tests a single input argument for equality against any number of preset `case`s. We can also provide a `default` output in the event that none of the `case`s match. Each case must be exited with a `break` statement or else the `switch` will continue testing values. Let's look at an example:

```javascript
const favoriteDay = 'Friday';
let reply;

switch (favoriteDay) {
    case 'Monday':
    case 'Tuesday':
        reply = 'You like the early weekdays.';
        break;
    case 'Wednesday':
        reply = 'You like hump day!';
        break;
    case 'Thursday':
        reply = 'Its almost the weekend';
        break;
    case 'Friday':
    case 'Saturday':
    case 'Sunday':
        reply = 'That is a party day.';
        break;
    default:
        reply = 'You did not pick a day.';
}

console.log(reply);
```

Here, depending on the value of `favoriteDay` we will see different output in our console.

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. Which do you think is easier to read, `if...elseif` statements or `switch` statements? Why?
> 2. Write a switch statement that tests a variable named `age`. pick at least 5 ages that are significant in people's lives, for example, you can buy alcohol at 21. Feel free to make some up. Store descriptions for those milestones in a variable and finally, log the variable to the console.

# Review


Review the code you wrote in the 'src/' folder to that generated into the 'dist/', what differences do you see in the code?

We learned many types of operators; assignment, comparison, arithmetic, and logical. That's acutally not all of them, feel free to look into some of the other types. 

We saw several types of `if` statements and `switch` statements.

# Assessment

1. What's the difference between `==` and `===`, and between `!=` and `!==`?
2. What does `(5 - 5 && 3 + 5) || (4 < 7 || 5 > 6)` evaluate to?
3. Write an `if` statement that console logs a joke when the boolean `jokeTime` is true.
4. Write an `if..else` statement that console logs 'Its going to rain' when the variable `rainChance` is > 40 and logs 'No rain today' otherwise.
5. Write an `If..elseif` that tests a variable named `temperature`. When `temperature` is greater than or equal to 212, console log 'The water is boiling!', if its less than or equal to 32, console log 'The water is freezing!' and otherwise console log 'The water is probably ok.'.
