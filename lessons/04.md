# Conditionals and Comparisons

Frequently as developers, we need to make decisions based on data we are given. We may or may not know what that data will look like, but we can account for many possibilities.

# Operators

JavaScript supports a number of operators and operators are a type of expression.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign a value to the left side operand based on the value of the right hand operand. The most basic form of this is `x = y` where the value of `y` is assigned to `x`.

| Name                      | Shorthand operator | Meaning   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Assignment                | x = y              | x = y     |
| Addition assignment       | x += y             | x = x + y |
| Subtraction assignment    | x -= y             | x = x - y |
| Multiplication assignment | x *= y             | x = x * y |
| Division assignment       | x /= y             | x = x / y |
| Remainder assignment      | x %= y             | x = x % y |

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare its operands and return a boolean value based on that comparison.

| Operator | Description | Example returning `true` | Example returning `false` |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Equal (`==`) | Returns `true` if the operands are equal | `5 == '5'` | `5 == 3` |
| Not equal (`!=`) | Returns `true` if the operands are not equal | `5 != 3` | `5 != '5'` |
| Strict equal (`===`) | Returns `true` if the operands are equal and of the same type | `5 === 5` | `5 === '5'` |
| Strict not equal (`!==`) | Returns `true` if either the operands are not equal or not of the same type | `5 !== '5'` | `5 !== 5` |
| Greater than (`>`) | Returns `true` if the left operand is greater than the right operand | `5 > 3` | `5 > 8` |
| Greater than or equal (`>=`) | Returns `true` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand | `5 >= 3` | `5 >= 8` |
| Less than (`<`) | Returns `true` if the left operand is less than the right operand | `5 < 8` | `5 < 3` |
| Less than or equal (`<=`) | Returns `true` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand | `5 <= 8` | `5 <= 3` |

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators accept an numerical value as an operand on either side and return a numerical value. The basic arithmetic operators are addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

In addition to these operators, JavaScript provides,

| Operator | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Remainder (`%`) | Binary operator. Returns the integer remainder of dividing two operands | `8 % 3` returns `2` |
| Increment (`++`) | Unary operator. Adds one to its operand. If used as a prefix operator (`++x`), returns the value of its operand after adding one; if used as a postfix operator (`x++`), returns the value of its operand before adding one. | If x is 3, then ++x sets x to 4 and returns 4, whereas x++ returns 3 and, only then, sets x to 4. |
| Decrement (`--`) | Unary operator. Subtracts one from its operand. The return pattern is similar to the increment operator. | If x is 3, then --x sets x to 2 and returns 2, whereas x-- returns 3 and, only then, sets x to 2. |
| Unary Negation (`-`) | Unary operator. Returns the negation of the value | 
| Unary Plus (`+`) | 
| Exponent Operator (`**`) |
