# Arrays

## What are arrays for?

An *array* is much like a list of items. We typically use arrays to group related or similarly shaped sets of data.

## Creating an array

We can create an `array` in two ways, using the literal syntax and through the `Array()` constructor. Let's look at how each of these work.

```javascript
// Create an empty array using the literal syntax.
let literalArray = [];

// Create an empty array using the constructor syntax.
let constructorArray = new Array();
```

We can also create arrays with data already in them.

```javascript
// Create an array using the literal syntax.
let duckArray = ['Daffy', 'Donald', 'Howard'];

// Create an array using the constructor syntax.
let ledZep = new Array('Jimmy Page', 'Robert Plant', 'John Paul Jones', 'John Bonham');
```

## How big was it again?

Just like with strings, we can access the `length` property of an array to find how how many elements the array contains. For example we know that the `duckArray` has three elements:

```javascript
duckArray.length;
// 3
```

## Accessing elements of an array

Each 'thing' in an array is called an *element*. Each element in an array can be found at its specific *index*. The first element in an array is located at the index 0. We access array elements using square brackets `[` and `]`.

```javascript
// Access the first array element from ledZep.
console.log(ledZep[0]); // 'Jimmy Page'

// Access the 3rd element of the ledZep array.
console.log(ledZep[2]); // 'John Paul Jones'
```

The value inside the square brackets can be an expression, meaning we can substitute a static value for anything that evaluates to a value, be it a variable, some math, even invoking a function that returns a value.

```javascript
// Access the last element of the ledZep array
let lastIndex = ledZep.length - 1;
console.log(ledZep[lastIndex]); // 'John Bonham'

// Access each element of the ledZep array in a loop
for(let i = 0; i < ledZep.length; i++) {
    console.log(ledZep[i]);
}
// 'Jimmy Page'
// 'Robert Plant'
// 'John Paul Jones'
// 'John Bonham'
```

#### Exercise Break!

> Create an array named after your favorite band with each band member as an element of the array. console log the size of the array and each individual element.

## Adding elements to an array

JavaScript provides several methods we can call to add elements to an array. Any time an item is added or removed from an array, the whole array is reindexed, that is, each element is reassigned its place in the array.

To add an element to the end or beginning of an array, we can use the `push()` and `unshift()` methods. Let's check it out now.

```javascript
// create an array named dunderMifflin with 'Pam' in it.
let dunderMifflin = ['Pam'];
// Add 'Michael' to the beginning of the array.
dunderMifflin.unshift('Michael');
// Add 'Creed' to the end.
dunderMifflin.push('Creed');

console.log(dunderMifflin);
// ["Michael", "Pam", "Creed"]
```

We can also add elements in the middle of an array with the `splice` method. [Let's look at how it works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice). Now, let's add some more elements to the `dunderMifflin` array.

```javascript
console.log(dunderMifflin); // What's in dunderMifflin
// ["Michael", "Pam", "Creed"]

dunderMifflin.splice(2, 0, 'Jim');

console.log(dunderMifflin); // Now, what's in dunderMifflin
// ["Michael","Pam","Jim","Creed"]
```

#### Exercise Break!

> Take the array with your favorite band, then add 'Rob Thomas' after the first element and 'Carlos Santana' *before* the last element. Log the output.

## Deleting elements from an array

We can use the `splice` method to remove array elements. You should recall that the second argument in the `splice` method is the number of elements we want to delete. Let's build upon the `dunderMifflin` examples above by removing 'Pam'.

```javascript
...
console.log(dunderMifflin); // Now, what's in dunderMifflin
// ["Michael","Pam","Jim","Creed"]
dunderMifflin.splice(1, 1);
console.log(dunderMifflin);
// ["Michael","Jim","Creed"]
```

> Let's go back to your band array. Rob Thomas doesn't belong in any band, remove him from the array and log the output.

> 1. Log the size of the array to your console.
> 1. Before the first element, add 'Tamales'.
> 1. After the last element, add 'Calzones'.
> 1. Anywhere in the middle, add 'Tres Leches'.
