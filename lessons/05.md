# Arrays

## What are arrays for?

An *array* is much like a list of items. We typically use arrays to group related or similarly shaped sets of data.

---

## Creating an array

We can create an `array` in two ways, using the literal syntax and through the `Array()` constructor. Let's look at how each of these work.

```javascript
// Create an empty array using the literal syntax.
let literalArray = [];

// Create an empty array using the constructor syntax.
// This is less common and the literal style is typically preferred.
let constructorArray = new Array();
```

We can also create arrays with data already in them.

```javascript
// Create an array using the literal syntax.
let duckArray = ['Daffy', 'Donald', 'Howard'];

// Create an array using the constructor syntax.
let ledZep = new Array('Jimmy Page', 'Robert Plant', 'John Paul Jones', 'John Bonham');
```

## How big was it again?

Just like with strings, we can access the `length` property of an array to find how how many elements the array contains. For example we know that the `duckArray` has three elements:

```javascript
duckArray.length;
// 3
```

---

## Accessing elements of an array

Each 'thing' in an array is called an *element*. Each element in an array can be found at its specific *index*. The first element in an array is located at the index 0. We access array elements using square brackets `[` and `]`.

```javascript
// Access the first array element from ledZep.
console.log(ledZep[0]); // 'Jimmy Page'

// Access the 3rd element of the ledZep array.
console.log(ledZep[2]); // 'John Paul Jones'
```

The value inside the square brackets can be an expression, meaning we can substitute a static value for anything that evaluates to a value, be it a variable, some math, even invoking a function that returns a value.

```javascript
// Access the last element of the ledZep array
let lastIndex = ledZep.length - 1;
console.log(ledZep[lastIndex]); // 'John Bonham'

// Access each element of the ledZep array in a loop
for(let i = 0; i < ledZep.length; i++) {
    console.log(ledZep[i]);
}
// 'Jimmy Page'
// 'Robert Plant'
// 'John Paul Jones'
// 'John Bonham'
```

> Create an array named after your favorite band with each band member as an element of the array. console log the size of the array and each individual element.

---

## Adding elements to an array

JavaScript provides several methods we can call to add elements to an array. Any time an item is added or removed from an array, the whole array is reindexed, that is, each element is reassigned its place in the array.

To add an element to the end or beginning of an array, we can use the `push()` and `unshift()` methods. Let's check it out now.

```javascript
// create an array named dunderMifflin with 'Pam' in it.
let dunderMifflin = ['Pam'];
// Add 'Michael' to the beginning of the array.
dunderMifflin.unshift('Michael');
// Add 'Creed' to the end.
dunderMifflin.push('Creed');

console.log(dunderMifflin);
// ["Michael", "Pam", "Creed"]
```

We can also add elements in the middle of an array with the `splice` method. [Let's look at how it works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice). Now, let's add some more elements to the `dunderMifflin` array.

```javascript
console.log(dunderMifflin); // What's in dunderMifflin
// ["Michael", "Pam", "Creed"]

dunderMifflin.splice(2, 0, 'Jim');

console.log(dunderMifflin); // Now, what's in dunderMifflin
// ["Michael","Pam","Jim","Creed"]
```

#### Exercise Break!

> Take the array with your favorite band, then add 'Rob Thomas' after the first element and 'Carlos Santana' *before* the last element. Log the output.

---

## Deleting elements from an array

We can use the `splice` method to remove array elements. You should recall that the second argument in the `splice` method is the number of elements we want to delete. Let's build upon the `dunderMifflin` examples above by removing 'Pam'.

```javascript
...
console.log(dunderMifflin); // Now, what's in dunderMifflin
// ["Michael","Pam","Jim","Creed"]
dunderMifflin.splice(1, 1);
console.log(dunderMifflin);
// ["Michael","Jim","Creed"]
```

# Objects

## What are objects for?

We learned that *array*s are lists of data. JavaScript `object`s are similar, except that they are more structured. Rather than having *elements* that are numerically indexed, an *object* contains pairs of keys or more precisely, *properties* and *values*. We typically use `object`s to describe 'things'.

---

## Creating an object

Just like everything else we've seen so far, `object`s can be created in two ways. The most common way, an *object literal* is created using curly braces '{' and '}'.

```javascript
const movie = {};
```

Here, we've created an empty movie, it exists, but there is nothing interesting about it, like *50 Shades of Grey*. We may also use the `object` constructor syntax, but there isn't often a reason to.

```javascript
const person = new Object();
```

Finally, we can create an `object` with properties.

```javascript
const album = {
    artist: 'Prince',
    available: true,
    releaseYear: 1984,
    title: 'Purple Rain',
    trackList: [
        "Let's Go Crazy",
        "Take Me with U",
        "The Beautiful Ones",
        "Computer Blue",
        "Darling Nikki",
        "When Doves Cry",
        "I Would Die 4 U",
        "Baby I'm a Star",
        "Purple Rain",
    ],
};
```

## Assigning and accessing properties in an object

As you noticed above, object *properties* can be just about anything. In fact, the properties of an object function just like variables and can contain anything a variable can contain.

We can assign properties to an object by using *dot syntax* `.`, and access the properties in the same manner. Let's add more properties to the `album` object and then retrieve some.

```javascript
// Starting with the album object above.
album.label = 'Warner Bros.';
album.genre = ['R&B', 'rock', 'funk', 'pop', 'new wave', 'soul'];

console.log(album.artist);
// "Prince"
console.log(album.releaseYear);
// 1984
console.log(album.trackList[0]);
// "Let's Go Crazy"

if (album.available) {
    console.log('You can buy the album.');
}
// "You can buy the album."
```

#### Exercise Break!

> 1. In the `album` object, why did we access `album.trackList` the way we did?
> 2. Starting with the empty `movie` object above, add some properties. At at least one each of properties that contain strings, booleans, numbers, and arrays.
> 3. Write an `if..else` statement that console logs something depending on the boolean value in your movie object.

---

## Deleting properties from an object

Finally, we can remove properties from an object by using the `delete` operator.

```javascript
// Starting with the album object above.
delete album.label;

console.log(album.label);
// undefined
```
