# Node.js, NPM, Gulp, and Babel

## Node.js

**Node.js** is a web platform built on Google's JavaScript engine, V8. It provides a way to run a web server virtual machine via JavaScript. As a result, front-end developers can with relative ease, create full-stack web applications in JavaScript and write both front- and back end code in a language they already know.

## NPM

**NPM** or the Node Package Manger is a tool that empowers a developer or team of developers to maintain and define JavaScript plugins and utilities and their dependencies.

Browse all the plugins here: https://www.npmjs.com/.

## Gulp

Gulp.js is a workflow automation tool. It provides an API for defining tasks such as moving or renaming files and running other plugins such as Babel, Browserfy, Karma, Sass, and image optimization on a variety of files.

## Babel

Babel is a JavaScript compiler, it says so right on their website. Babel allows programmers to write future-facing and presently standard JavaScript and compile it down to code that will work on nearly any browser, regardless of support for current trends.

# Setting up a Workstation for Developing Modern Code

Install Node.js via the installer available at https://nodejs.org

Create a folder.

In the command line, go to that folder and run the following command:

```bash
npm init
```

Follow the on screen wizard.

Let's take a look at *package.json*.

Next, lets install some plugins. In the command line, enter the following commands,

```bash
npm install --save-dev gulp
npm install --save-dev gulp-sourcemaps
npm install --save-dev gulp-babel
npm install --save-dev gulp-watch
```

or just this command,

```bash
npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-sourcemaps gulp-babel gulp-watch
```

Next, in the root of our folder, let's create a file and call it `gulpfile.js` and lets add the following code.

```javascript
// Source of gulpfile.js

var gulp = require("gulp");
var babel = require("gulp-babel");

gulp.task('babel', function () {
    return gulp.src("src/*.js")
        .pipe(babel())
        .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));
});

gulp.task('default', ['babel'], function() {});
```

In the command line, run the command,

```bash
gulp
```

and you should see something similar to,

```bash
[22:00:49] Using gulpfile gulpfile.js
[22:00:49] Starting 'babel'...
[22:00:49] Finished 'babel' after 9.72 ms
[22:00:49] Starting 'default'...
[22:00:49] Finished 'default' after 9.95 Î¼s
```

Next let's create a new JavaScript file called *src/variables.js*. Copy the functions `varTest()` and `letTest()` from the scope section. Run the `gulp` command again and let's see what happens.

We *should* see similar output from before, but now, if we look at our file system, we should also see a new folder titled 'dist'. Inside that folder, let's compare that version of *variables.js* to the one in src.

Isn't this great?

Let's make it greater. If I haven't mentioned it yet, I'll mention that great programmers are lazy, meaning we try not to repeat ourselves too many times. We don't want to manually run `gulp` each time we add a or modify a file, so let's set up a *watch* task.

Back in our gulpfile, let's add a new function,

```bash
gulp.task('watch', function() {
    gulp.watch('src/*.js', ['babel']);
});
```

Next, we'll add new array element to the default task.

```bash
gulp.task('default', ['babel', 'watch'], function() {});
```

If we've done everything correctly, when we run `gulp` next, the process will not terminate and any file we add or modify will automatically be processed. (If you want to manually end the process, just press `control + c`).
