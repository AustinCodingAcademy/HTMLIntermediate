# Node.js, NPM, Gulp, and Babel

## Node.js

**Node.js** is a web platform built on Google's JavaScript engine, V8. It provides a way to run a web server virtual machine via JavaScript. As a result, front-end developers can with relative ease, create full-stack web applications in JavaScript and write both front- and back end code in a language they already know.

## NPM

**NPM** or the Node Package Manger is a tool that empowers a developer or team of developers to maintain and define JavaScript plugins and utilities and their dependencies.

Browse all the plugins here: https://www.npmjs.com/.

## Gulp

Gulp.js is a workflow automation tool. It provides an API for defining tasks such as moving or renaming files and running other plugins such as Babel, Browserfy, Karma, Sass, and image optimization on a variety of files.

## Babel

Babel is a JavaScript compiler, it says so right on their website. Babel allows programmers to write future-facing and presently standard JavaScript and compile it down to code that will work on nearly any browser, regardless of support for current trends.

# Setting up a Workstation for Developing Modern Code

Install Node.js via the installer available at https://nodejs.org

Create a folder.

In the command line, go to that folder and run the following command:

```bash
npm init
```

Follow the on screen wizard.

Let's take a look at *package.json*.

Next, lets install some plugins. In the command line, enter the following commands,

```bash
npm install --save-dev gulp
npm install --save-dev gulp-sourcemaps
npm install --save-dev gulp-babel
npm install --save-dev gulp-watch
```

or just this command,

```bash
npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-sourcemaps gulp-babel gulp-watch
```

Next, in the root of our folder, let's create a file and call it `gulpfile.js` and lets add the following code.

```javascript
// Source of gulpfile.js

var gulp = require("gulp");
var babel = require("gulp-babel");

gulp.task('babel', function () {
    return gulp.src("src/*.js")
        .pipe(babel())
        .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));
});

gulp.task('default', ['babel'], function() {});
```
