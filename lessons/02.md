# JavaScript Syntax and Variables

In this section, we will learn the basics of JavaScript Syntax and how to define, modify, and retrieve variables. We will also learn the new variable assignment keywords introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).

# Statements and Expressions

JavaScript has two major categories of syntax, *statements* and *expressions*.

**Statements** make things happen, for example, when we declare a new variable using the `var` keyword:

```javascript
var fooBar;
```

**Expressions** produce values. They might be the right-side of a variable declaration or the arguments to a function. Here's an example of an expressions:

```javascript
10 + 5;
```

Let's look at two examples of code that produce the same effect, one is a statement and the other an expression.

```javascript
// The following is a statement
var x;
if (y >= 0) {
    x = 100;
} else {
    x = -100;
}

// The following is an expression
var x = y => 0 ? 100 : -100;
```

# Semicolons

Semicolons are not always required in JavaScript, however I recommend you always use them. Semicolons should always be placed at the end of a statement.

```javascript
var foo = 'A car named Herbie'; // ← Notice that semicolon
var fun = function() {}; // ← That one, too.
```

# Comments

Comments are lines in code that aren't interpreted, JavaScript has two kinds, single- and multi-line comments. Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//) and run until the end of the line.

```javascript
bar++; // single-line comment
```

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`

```javascript
/* Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite
   jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his back a
   thousand times, and now how abhorr'd in my imagination it is!
   My gorge rises at it.
 */
```
